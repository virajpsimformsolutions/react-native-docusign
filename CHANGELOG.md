# Changelog

## Next

### New features

- **Android**: Add `presentCaptiveSigningWithUrl` support. The URL flow now has iOS/Android parity and does not require `loginWithAccessToken`.

## 1.0.5

### New features

- New `reset()` API on iOS and Android. Heavier counterpart to `endSigningSession`: resolves any in-flight signing promise as cancelled, wipes WebKit data on iOS (cookies, service workers, fetch cache, IndexedDB, etc.), calls `logout()`, removes notification observers, and flips the internal `isInitialized` flag to `false` so the next `initialize()` call re-runs the underlying SDK setup against a fresh state. Use it for hard resets (error recovery, switching DocuSign accounts, app-level logout). For routine per-flow teardown on the same auth, prefer `endSigningSession`, which keeps the SDK initialized and avoids the observer churn.

## 1.0.4

### Bug fixes

- **iOS**: Fix endless "we encountered an error, retrying..." loop in the captive signing UI on the second consecutive attempt within the same install. The signing UI registers a service worker on first visit, and `WKWebsiteDataStore.removeData` was being called with an explicit type set that did not include `WKWebsiteDataTypeServiceWorkerRegistrations` or the fetch cache. The stale service worker survived cookie clearing, app force-close, and even SDK-level logout, then intercepted the next signing WebView's fetch calls with stale cached responses. `clearWebCookiesAsync` now passes `WKWebsiteDataStore.allWebsiteDataTypes()`, which wipes service workers, fetch cache, disk cache, and every other WebKit-persisted data type.
- **iOS**: Always run the WebKit teardown before `DSMManager.login`, including on the first login of a process. The previous "skip teardown when `hasLoggedIn = false`" optimization assumed a fresh process implies fresh WebKit data; that assumption is wrong because `WKWebsiteDataStore` persists across iOS process kills while the in-memory `hasLoggedIn` flag does not. After a force-close, the next login is treated as "first" by the SDK and would skip the wipe, leaving the previous session's service worker behind.

### Build / packaging

- **Android**: Switch `sdk-pdf-2.1.4-stripped` import from `flatDir`-based `implementation(name: ..., ext: 'aar')` to a direct `implementation files("$projectDir/libs/sdk-pdf-2.1.4-stripped.aar")`. Gradle 9.0 no longer honors subproject-scoped `flatDir` when resolving across project boundaries, so the stripped AAR (placed by the Config Plugin) was not being found and the build failed with `Could not find :sdk-pdf-2.1.4-stripped:`.

## 1.0.3

### Build / packaging

- **No third-party binaries shipped.** The DocuSign `sdk-pdf-2.1.4.aar` is no longer committed to the repo or included in the npm tarball. The Expo Config Plugin now downloads it directly from DocuSign's public Maven (`docucdn-a.akamaihd.net`) at `expo prebuild` time, strips the pre-generated `com.bumptech.glide.GeneratedAppGlideModuleImpl` class to prevent duplicate-class collisions with `expo-image` and other Glide-based libraries, and writes the stripped result into `node_modules/react-native-docusign/android/libs/`. The existing flatDir injection picks it up unchanged. Result: zero DocuSign IP redistributed; consumers fetch the SDK directly from DocuSign on first prebuild.
- New `dependencies` entry: `adm-zip` (used by the Config Plugin to strip the upstream AAR in-memory).
- Added `LICENSE` (MIT). Previously declared in `package.json` but the file was missing.
- `package.json` adds a `prepublishOnly` hook that runs `npm run build && npm test` so stale builds can never ship.

### Notes for consumers

- After `npm install`, run `npx expo prebuild` (or `expo prebuild --clean`) so the plugin can fetch and place the stripped sdk-pdf AAR. Required network access: `https://docucdn-a.akamaihd.net`.
- If the host machine cannot reach DocuSign's CDN, the plugin emits a warning and the Android build will fail at the dex step. CI environments must allow outbound HTTPS to that host.

## 1.0.2

### Bug fixes

- **iOS**: Fix captive signing hang on second consecutive open. The implicit teardown inside `performLogin` (logout + `clearAllWebCookies`) raced with `DSMManager.login`, leaving the WebView session bootstrapped against half-cleaned SDK state. The captive signing UI would render but the underlying `DSMEnvelopesManager` never fired its expected `settings` / `consumer_disclosure` / `recipient` requests, leaving the JS promise hanging on a spinner with no completion notification. The teardown is now sequenced via `WKWebsiteDataStore.removeData` completion before `DSMManager.login` is invoked, and skipped entirely on the first login.

### New features

- New `endSigningSession()` API on both iOS and Android. Tears down any in-flight signing session and the underlying SDK auth state so the next `loginWithAccessToken` + `presentCaptiveSigning` pair starts from a clean slate. Wired into `useDocuSignSigning`'s `reset()` automatically, so React consumers get clean teardown between captive signing flows for free.

### Tests

- Add Jest setup with `jest-expo` preset.
- Cover `useDocuSignSigning` state machine end-to-end: auto-init, session and url signing flows, completed / cancelled / error transitions, error listener subscription, error listener cleanup on unmount, and the `reset()` -> `endSigningSession` wiring.

## 1.0.1

### Documentation

- Surface the unified iOS/Android session payload contract in the README. New "One backend response, both platforms" callout names the 13 expected fields and links to the full schema in `docs/BACKEND_GUIDE.md`.

## 1.0.0

### New features

- Initial release.
- iOS native module wrapping DocuSign iOS SDK 4.1.1.
- Android native module wrapping DocuSign Android SDK 2.1.4.
- TypeScript public API: `initialize`, `loginWithAccessToken`, `presentCaptiveSigning`, `logout`, `isLoggedIn`.
- Event listeners: `onSigningComplete`, `onSigningCancelled`, `onSigningError`.
- React hook `useDocuSignSigning` wrapping the SDK lifecycle, state machine, and event subscription.
- Config plugin for automatic iOS Info.plist, Android permissions, and Maven repo setup.
